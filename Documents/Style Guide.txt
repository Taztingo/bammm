BAMMM STYLE GUIDE
•	Everything in camel case (ForExample).
•	Classes and file names should always begin with an uppercase letter. 
•	Variables and functions should always start with a lowercase letter.
•	Member variables (private variables that can be accessed through public functions) must start with the underscore character.
•	All variables and functions should have complete, English names. Not abbreviations. (i.e., GetArmor, not gArmor).
•	We will use doc style comments (starting with /** and ending with */) at the top of each class and the top of each function. For the classes, we will use the parameters: @file, @class, @brief, @author, and @version. For the functions we will use: @brief, @param, @return.
•	All comments should be a combination of /* ended by */. We will not use // comments.
